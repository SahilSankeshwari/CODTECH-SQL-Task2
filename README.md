**Explanation**:

Window Function:

RANK() provides a ranking for employees based on their salary.

Useful for comparisons or hierarchical analysis.

Subquery:

Calculates the average salary dynamically and uses it to filter employees.

Ideal for relative comparisons.

CTE(COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS):

Creates a reusable subset of data for employees with high salaries.

Simplifies complex queries and improves readability.
